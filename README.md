This workshop will go over using Big Data techniques on HPC resources. Big Data methods are used when data size because so large, it becomes challenging to compute. Also, when machine learning models become so complex, it can also be challenging to train. In this workshop, we will go over examples of solving Big Data problems on UCLAâ€™s HPC resource Hoffman2. This is an introductory workshop is intended to showcase various Big Data software and libraries, such as, Spark and Dask.
